<p>Theme of Ludum Dare 34 was <strong>Two Button Controls</strong>, my entry is a dragonfly flight sim with two buttons.</p>

<p>Using only A and D, a pretty dragonfly can float around a flower field and catch coins.</p>

<p>While not very easy to control, this strange aircraft has a pretty wide range of movement in a three dimensional space.</p>

<p>Scrabble Invader ranked <strong>183rd in Graphics</strong>, among 2800 contestants.</p>
