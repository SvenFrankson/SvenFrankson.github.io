<p>Theme of Ludum Dare 41 was <strong>Two Incompatible Genders</strong>, so I mixed Scrabble with Space Invader.</p>

<p>This game has a fairly good number of features for a Hackathon.</p>

<p>Killing invaders gives letters which can be placed to write words.</p>

<p>Upon completing words, player gets XP tokens which buys mods to enhance it's spaceship.</p>

<p>Scrabble words can be validated against a French or an English dictionnary, at player's convenience.</p>
