<p>Lego Builder is my first BabylonJS demo, intended as a proof a concept for one of Versusmind's projet.</p>

<p><strong>Version V1</strong> is a desktop application where you may build Lego constructions. Bricks are created procedurally and some JSON saving is implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Version VR</strong> is a mobile one, playable in VR using a Google Cardboard compatible phone. This time, saving is made using local-storage, no files needed.</p>
