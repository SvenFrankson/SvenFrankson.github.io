<p>PlanetBuilderWeb is a web-based implementation of my first project, PlanetBuilder.</p>

<p>PlanetBuilderWeb uses slighly more optimized algorithm for procedural mesh generation than the previous Unity based version, making it suitable for larger planets.</p>

<p>By adding some spherical control and gravity, this version is playable and features several construction blocks.</p>

<p>Reachable depth when digging the planet is augmented using nested planets of increasing subdivision degree.</p>
