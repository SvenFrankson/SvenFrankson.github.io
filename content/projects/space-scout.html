<p>SpaceScout project is a demo for a flight sim in space.</p>

<p>Very peaceful so far, the objective is to find some lost beacons in an asteroid minefield, with a help of your wingman.</p>

<p>Features a force-shield activated on asteroid impact, some custom physic engine and an efficient TrailRenderer.</p>

<p>The neat skybox was generated using <a href="https://wwwtyro.github.io/space-3d/"><strong>Space-3D</strong></a> project, thanks a lot to <a href="https://twitter.com/wwwtyro"><strong>wwwTyro</strong></a>.</p>
