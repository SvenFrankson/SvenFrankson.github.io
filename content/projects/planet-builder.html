<p>PlanetBuilder is a Spherical Voxel Engine, and my very-first Unity3D side project.</p>

<p>This Unity pluggin generates planets made of cube. Most interesting feature is in the fact the cubes are not drawn in cartesian coordinates (like Minecraft) but on a surface looking like an inflated cube : walking on the sphere surface, cubes always appear horizontal.</p>

<p>Project also features some 3D noise generation methods, extracting a 3D heightmap with holes and caves from a 4D computational space.</p>

<p>A Web based version of this project, using BabylonJS engine, was later implemented.</p>
